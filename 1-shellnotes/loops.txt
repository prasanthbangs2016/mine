======
fundamentally there are 2 loops 1-while 2-for loop
inverse the logic of those 2 loops we have another two more loops 3-until 4-select

while: 
=====
while loops work like if condition
syntax:
======
while [ expression ]; do
commands
done

note: if the expressions is true it will execute the commands.

examples
===========
i=10
while [ $i -lt 0 ]; do
#if 10 is >0 then execute command
  echo $i
  i=$(($i-1))
done

o/p:
---

fruit name = orange

  ssh $Component.roboshop.ppk "git clone https://github.com/prasanthbangs2016/mine.git"; cd mine/2-Roboshop-components-shell/sudo make $Component"
done

for comp in frontend mongodb catalogue redis user mysql shipping rabbitmq payment ; do
