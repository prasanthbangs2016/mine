Inputs
======
-Most of the times we cannot hardcode the values and at the same time we cannot dynamically determine the values
using command substitution.
- so we need input from the user and based on input,we proceed with the script.

-input in shell scripting can be taken into 2 ways

1-During execution:
 a- by using read command

 ex:
 #/bin/bash
 read -p 'Enter your name: ' name
 echo Your name = $name

 -this approach will be taken if for sure we know that script can be executed manually
 -otherwise this approach will not work for automation.it breaks the automation and ends with failures.





2-Before execution
Before executing the script we can provide the inputs and those inputs can be loaded by script.
those values will be loaded by special variables inside the script
this approach will be taken by most of the commands in the shell.
special variables are $0-$n,$*,$@,$#

$0=script name
$1 -$n - arguments passed in a order(n: meaning(1,2,3,4)
$*,$@ - all arguments
$# - no of arguments


 ex:
#/bin/bash
echo $0
echo $1
echo $*
echo $#

bash ppk.sh
bash ppk.sh 100
bash ppk 100 200
