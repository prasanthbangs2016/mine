<<comment
Let's now set up the catalogue application.

As part of operating system standards, we run all the applications and databases as a normal user but not with root user.

So to run the catalogue service we choose to run as a normal user and that user name should be more relevant to the project. Hence we will use roboshop as the username to run the service.
